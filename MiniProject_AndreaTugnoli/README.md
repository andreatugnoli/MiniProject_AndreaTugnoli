## Abstract

This file answers the following questions:
a. Purpose of the experiment -> What does it do?
b. Usage example and instruction -> How to run it?
c. References -> Who did it, when was it done?
d. What to expect -> How to interpret the final output?


### a. Purpose of the experiment

In this experiment, participants have to guess if the picture shown is a
painting. In this experiment, we show only paintings. Specifically, there
are 10 paintings shown both in color and black and white. 5 paintings are
landascape and 5 paintings are portraits. We show the same paintings in
color and black and white.


#### b. sage example and instruction

The requirements for run the experiment are:
- Matlab
- A working Psychtoolbox installation
To run this experiment, you have to open the file 'is_it_a_painting_experiment.m' and run the code.
The results of the experiment are stored in the folder 'PNT_S00001_01_221212_0934'.
To run the analysis, you have to open the file ''is_it_a_painting_analysis.m' and run the code
Instructions and a mockup of the experiment are available in 'mockup_is_it_a_painting.pdf'.


##### c. References
This experiment enters in the vast literature of the effect of different color on recognition and on reaction time.


###### d. What to expect

This experiment wants to prove the following hypothesis:
1. Participants make more mistake when the painting is black and white compared to color -> the question is answered in the analysis
2. Participants make more mistake when the painting is a portrait compared to a landscape. -> the question is answered in the analysis
3. The response time is higher for black and white than color pictures. -> the question is answered in the analysis
4. The response time is higher for portraits compared to landscapes. -> the question is answered in the analysis
5. The effect of black and white on response rate is higher on portraits compared to landscapes.
6. The effect of black and white on mistakes is higher on portraits compared to landscapes.
